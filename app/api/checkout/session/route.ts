/**
 * Marketplace checkout — the money path this whole tranche exists for.
 *
 * A DESTINATION CHARGE: the client pays Liminal, Stripe moves the balance to the
 * therapist's connected account, and `application_fee_amount` is what we keep.
 * The charge lives on the platform, so the platform is the merchant of record
 * and disputes land on us (controller.losses.payments = application).
 *
 * This is separate from /api/stripe/checkout and /portal/invoices/[id]/pay,
 * which are the pre-marketplace "money lands in the platform account" paths.
 * Those still work; this one is chosen when the invoice's therapist has a
 * connected account that Stripe says can actually take charges.
 *
 * MIGRATION NOTE (not tonight): the target is separate charges & transfers with
 * `source_transaction`, releasing the transfer when the appointment completes.
 * The no-show / late-cancel policy lives in that gap, which is why the split is
 * recorded as its own row rather than inferred from the charge later.
 *
 * PHI: the line item is generic and metadata carries internal ids only.
