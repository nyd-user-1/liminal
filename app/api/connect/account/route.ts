/**
 * Create the practitioner's Stripe connected account (v1 + controller
 * properties — see CONNECT_CONTROLLER). Idempotent by design: if the caller
 * already has an account we return it rather than minting a second one. A
 * duplicate connected account is not a cosmetic bug — it splits a therapist's
 * payout history and requires Stripe support to unwind.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT pass a country/email/business_type the user hasn't
 * given us. Stripe collects what it needs during onboarding; pre-filling from
 * our records would put us in the position of having asserted identity facts we
 * never verified.
