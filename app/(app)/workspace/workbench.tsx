//
//   Agents   the standing terminals; the card opens that agent's identity file
//            (~/.claude/agents/<name>-agent.md).
//   Reports  every lead_reports row, newest first — the nightly cross-terminal
//            digest, opened and edited in place.
//   Rules    the standards, one flat list now, each card carrying its category
//            (Design · Agent · Database) as a badge so the old tab grouping
//            survives the merge.
