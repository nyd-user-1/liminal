//
// WHY THESE VALUES (all measured against the live db 2026-07-20, not guessed):
//
//  * Client = Casey Morgan (the demo client login casey@liminal.demo). Casey's
//    three existing invoices are ALL `paid`, so before this row there was no
//    payable invoice in the portal at all and T4 had nothing to click.
//
//  * Appointment = the completed 2026-06-15 session, whose practitioner_id is
//    brendan@liminal.demo. That matters: an invoice reaches a therapist only
//    through its appointment, so the destination connected account resolves
//    off this column. Seeding with appointment_id NULL (as the existing demo
//    invoices have it) would leave a marketplace charge with nobody to pay.
//    brendan@liminal.demo is role=admin, which requireRole("practitioner")
//    accepts (lib/auth.ts:241) — so the same login creates the account and
//    owns the session being billed.
//
//  * number = INV-2026-9003. It MUST end in digits. nextInvoiceNumber()
//    (lib/repos/invoices.ts:215) does SUBSTRING(number FROM 10)::int over
//    every 'INV-2026-%' row, so a friendly number like 'INV-2026-QA01' makes
//    that cast throw and breaks invoice creation for the whole app. 9003 is
//    simply the next one after the 9001/9002 demo pair.
//
//  * status = 'sent'. The portal filters drafts out (app/portal/invoices/
//    page.tsx), so a draft is invisible to Casey.
//
//  * $150.00, so the 10% split is unmistakable in the report: gross 15000c,
//    application fee 1500c, therapist 13500c.
//
//  * Line item reads "Therapy session" — generic on purpose. The existing
//    checkout route forwards item descriptions into Stripe's product_data
//    (app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts:75), and Stripe signs no BAA.
