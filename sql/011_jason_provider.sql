$intro$Hey there, my name's Jason, and I'm a psychiatric nurse practitioner who's here to help you feel more like you again. I work with adults who are stressed, stuck, anxious, or just trying to keep it all together. This includes those who have a history of or may feel like they have anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, or ADHD. My style is laid-back but curious; I like asking the right questions so we can figure things out together. We can meet with in-person in my Reno office or online anywhere in the state of Nevada. Most of my clients are navigating that "How do I manage life and still feel okay?" stage. If that's you, just know that you're not alone. I've got your back, and I'm here to help.$intro$,
$approach$My job isn't just to treat symptoms—it's to understand you. I ask a lot of questions, not to dig for problems, but to get a real feel for who you are and what matters most to you. I see this as a team effort: your story and your goals, I'm just here to help you move forward. I mix therapy and medication where and when it makes sense to do so, and I tailor everything to fit you, not the other way around. You can expect honesty, curiosity, and a no-judgment zone every step of the way. Wherever you're starting from, I'm here to meet you there.$approach$,
$expect$You might not leave every session with all the answers, but you will always leave with someone firmly in your corner. I'll be your advocate, working with you to take the steps that move you toward feeling better, even if the progress is slow or the direction isn't always clear. I'll provide you with tools and options, like GeneSight testing to help guide medication choices, Moxo.ai for more in-depth ADHD assessments, or referrals to intensive outpatient therapy programs, if/when needed. I've often been told how easy it feels to talk with me, and that means the world to me. I'm not here to judge; I'm here to listen, understand, and help. For me, success isn't perfection—it's progress, no matter how small.$expect$,
