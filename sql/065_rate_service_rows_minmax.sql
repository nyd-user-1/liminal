-- Liminal — 065: rate_service_rows_mv grows min_rate / max_rate.
--
-- WHY. The Services tab rendered "2 rates" as a chip wherever a cell carries
-- several distinct published rates (NYS-64: billing_code_modifier is dropped at
-- ingest, so nothing separates them). Founder ruling 2026-07-23: never hide the
-- number behind a chip — show the rates. Picking ONE is still forbidden (it
-- invents a fact the payer never published), but showing ALL of them invents
-- nothing: for n_rates = 2, min and max ARE the two rates; for n > 2 the
-- honest render is the range plus the count.
--
-- Note the measured reality (2026-07-23, Cigna 90837): these multi-rate cells
-- are NOT the office/facility split — office and facility are already separate
-- rows (setting is part of the grain). A single office-setting cell really does
-- carry e.g. $88.17 AND $193.54 with nothing left to split on.
--
-- SWAP, NOT DROP+CREATE IN PLACE. Production reads this matview; building the
-- replacement under a temp name and renaming keeps the gap to two DDL
-- statements instead of the full multi-minute build.
--
-- Definition is sql/063 verbatim plus the two columns — every filter and the
-- cap are unchanged so a row keeps meaning exactly what it meant.
