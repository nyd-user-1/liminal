-- Six additional real, usable form templates (GAD-7, Consent to Treatment &
-- Privacy, Telehealth Consent, Release of Information, Financial Policy /
-- Card-on-File, Medication History) alongside the existing New Client Intake
-- (...10001) and PHQ-9 (...10002) from 002_seed.sql. Same block shape
-- (schema.blocks = [{id,type,label,options,required}]). Idempotent — safe to
-- re-run. Mirrored in lib/mock/forms.ts.
