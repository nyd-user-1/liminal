-- Liminal — 032: rate_table_child_mv — the rows a payer actually published.
--
-- WHAT A CHILD IS. One row per (billing ID, insurer, NPI, network, setting).
-- That is the grain Cigna publishes at, and every one is a LITERAL row in their
-- file — not a cross-product we constructed. Georgianna Dart (NPI 1750644324)
-- under ein:226019101 has four, all dated 2026-07-01:
--   localplus / CSTM-00     90791 $155.00   90837 $130.00   99214 —
--   national-oap / CSTM-00  90791 $155.00   90837 $130.00   99214 —
--   national-oap / facility 90791 $133.02   90837 $132.21   99214 $83.83
--   national-oap / office   90791 $137.47   90837 $133.02   99214 $116.98
-- Four rows, three distinct prices (the CSTM-00 pair agrees), and 99214 is the
-- proof they are not one row smeared four ways: blank on CSTM-00, $83.83 in a
-- facility, $116.98 in an office.
--
-- WHY NETWORK AND SETTING ARE COLUMNS, NOT A GROUP BY. Collapsing them is the
-- mistake this file corrects. sql/027 grouped to (tin, payer, code) and called
-- the collisions "multi-rate"; the FIRST cut of this file grouped to
-- (tin, payer, npi, code) and did the same thing one level down — Dart's cell
-- read "3 rates" when those three are an office rate, a facility rate and a
-- custom-network rate, each one a fact. Both columns are present on 826,572 of
-- 826,572 rows (0 missing), as is file_date. Nothing is inferred; they are
-- carried.
--
-- Resolution at this grain: 91.0% of (npi, network, setting, code) cells hold
-- exactly ONE rate — vs 82.0% at (npi, code) and 45.5% at sql/027's (tin, code).
-- The 9% that remain have every column we store identical and differ anyway.
-- That is NYS-64 (scan-tic drops billing_code_modifier), not a grain choice, and
-- no regrouping reaches it; n_rates carries the count for exactly those.
--
-- ── THE CAP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Gated on the row's OWN leaf count for THIS payer — not the TIN's roster across
-- every payer. That was the earlier bug: ein:223376459 has a 59-NPI roster, so
-- all three of its rows lost their children, including an EmblemHealth row with
-- exactly ONE clinician in that book.
--   <=100 leaves   38,474 rows  <- this MV
--   >100 leaves       242 rows -> 108,135 children, 48% of the total, excluded.
-- The largest is Headway. Nobody reads a 10,873-row roster inline; /orgs owns
-- those rosters.
--
-- ── REFRESH ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Reads only provider_rate_signals + directory_providers, so it has no ordering
-- dependency on the naming scripts — but refresh it WITH 027, or the two halves
-- of one row disagree about what the payer published:
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rate_table_mv;         -- 027
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rate_table_child_mv;   -- 032 (this)
-- Every filter below is copied from sql/027 ON PURPOSE and must stay identical —
-- a child whose filters differ from its parent's is a child that does not add up
-- to it.

-- (payer, tin, npi, network, setting) is the grain. `setting` is a pipe-joined
-- service_code list up to ~90 chars, so it is hashed into the unique index
-- rather than indexed whole.
-- CORRECTION (NYS-88): the original intent — "so REFRESH CONCURRENTLY works" —
-- was wrong, and this md5 index never enabled it. REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
-- CONCURRENTLY needs a unique index on PLAIN COLUMNS; an expression column like
-- md5(setting) disqualifies it (Postgres matview.c requires a real attribute
-- number for every indexed column). sql/036 is the fix: a plain-column unique
-- index on the verified-unique grain, dropping this md5 one — refresh went from
-- impossible-concurrently (ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, hangs /rates) to non-blocking ~11.6s.
