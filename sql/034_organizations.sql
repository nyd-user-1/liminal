-- Liminal — 034: organizations, the NPI-2 org book (NYS-41).
--
-- WHAT A ROW IS. One healthcare ORGANIZATION (NPPES entity_type 2 — a company,
-- not a person), keyed on its NPI. This is the first table that names the
-- billing-group world in its own right rather than as an anonymous TIN string.
--
-- WHY IT IS A TABLE + REFRESH FUNCTION, NOT A SCRIPT OR A MATVIEW. The whole
-- scope is derivable in pure SQL from tables we already hold (nppes_npi + the
-- reference/rate/FHIR layers), so a streaming .mjs would be ceremony around a
-- SELECT. It is a real table (not a materialized view) because the brief wants
-- first-class columns a matview can't carry across refreshes: stable
-- created_at/updated_at, and the cross-link flags into the billing-TIN world.
-- refresh_organizations() below is the "refresh function" — pure SQL, callable
-- from the post-ingest chain after each NPPES load, and a TRUE no-op on re-run
-- (the upsert is change-guarded: unchanged rows are not rewritten, so
-- updated_at does not move and GET DIAGNOSTICS reports 0 rows touched).
--
-- ── THE SCOPE PREDICATE (union, deduped on npi) ────────────────────────────
-- Leg 1 — every entity_type-2 NPI whose PRACTICE-LOCATION state is NY (103,772).
-- Leg 2 — every entity_type-2 NPI any of OUR datasets references nationwide,
--   the "national platforms" leg: an npi-type TIN in provider_rate_signals /
--   tin_registry / org_tin_rosters, or an npi in provider_network_participation
--   or fhir_organizations. Measured 2026-07-16: 5,079 referenced orgs, of which
--   3,294 overlap leg 1 and 1,785 are net-new out-of-state platforms.
-- Union = 105,557. (Headway's billing orgs — HEADWAY COLORADO/CALIFORNIA/
-- MICHIGAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES — resolve here: type-2, NEW YORK NY.)
--
-- CRITICAL: leg 2 joins nppes_npi ON entity_type=2. Most npi-type TINs are NOT
-- orgs — 10,028 of 13,158 are individuals billing as themselves (a solo
-- clinician's own NPI standing in for a tax id). Pulling them in unfiltered
-- would make an "org book" that is 76% people. The entity_type join is the gate.
--
-- ── WHAT THE SOURCE TABLES DO NOT HAVE (the brief named these; the tables win)─
--   * NO EIN. NPPES carries none for orgs (nppes_organizations.ein is 0/104,060
--     populated). Settled 2026-07-14; there is deliberately no ein column here.
--   * NO mailing address/state. sql/030 loaded selected columns only (the
--     dissemination file is 330 cols / ~10GB); mailing address was not among
--     them. Only mail_phone exists, and it is not an address. Omitted, not faked.
--   * authorized_official is NAME ONLY and NY-ONLY. It lives in
--     nppes_organizations (sql/025), which is NY-scoped (103,772/104,060 NY) and
--     stores no title/phone split. So it is populated for NY orgs, NULL for the
--     national net-new leg. Surfaced honestly, not invented.
--
-- Idempotent — safe to re-run. Both the DDL and refresh_organizations() are.
