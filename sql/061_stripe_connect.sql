-- Liminal — 061: Stripe Connect marketplace tables (TASK-STRIPE-MARKETPLACE, tranche 1).
--
-- The money model: a client pays LIMINAL, Liminal pays the therapist's connected
-- account, Liminal keeps an application fee. Tranche 1 uses DESTINATION CHARGES
-- (`transfer_data[destination]` + `application_fee_amount` on a platform Checkout
-- Session), so Stripe moves the money in one hop and these tables only have to
-- record WHO the account is, WHAT Stripe currently allows it to do, and HOW a
-- given payment split.
--
-- Accounts are v1 with CONTROLLER PROPERTIES (not legacy `type=express`):
--   controller[stripe_dashboard][type] = express
--   controller[fees][payer]            = application
--   controller[losses][payments]       = application
-- Requirement collection stays with Stripe; the service agreement stays `full`
-- and is IMMUTABLE per account. Founder-locked 2026-07-20 — see the brief.
--
--   stripe_connect_accounts  one row per payable entity. Today that is a
--                            practitioner (user_id). The group-practice future
--                            is ONE company account per billing TIN, so org_tin
--                            is here now and nullable — a row carries exactly
--                            one owner, enforced below.
--   stripe_events            every webhook event we have accepted, keyed by the
--                            Stripe event id. This IS the idempotency ledger:
--                            the handler inserts first and only does work when
--                            the insert wins, so a redelivered event is a no-op.
--   stripe_payment_splits    the audit-grade record of a marketplace payment —
--                            gross, our application fee, what the therapist got,
--                            and the destination account. Written from the
--                            webhook (the authoritative path), never from the
--                            success redirect.
--
-- NO PHI ANYWHERE IN THESE TABLES OR IN ANYTHING WE SEND STRIPE. Line items say
-- "Therapy session"; metadata carries internal ids only. Stripe signs no BAA.
