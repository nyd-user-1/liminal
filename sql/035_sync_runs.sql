-- Liminal — 035: sync_runs, the maintenance log (NYS-84).
--
-- WHAT A ROW IS. One invocation of a scheduled maintenance job — today the
-- daily derived-view refresh at /api/cron/daily, tomorrow whatever else earns a
-- schedule. A row is opened when the job starts and closed when it ends, so a
-- run that never finished is visible as exactly that: status='running' with a
-- started_at and no finished_at. A job that only ever wrote a row on SUCCESS
-- would be a log that goes quiet precisely when something is wrong.
--
-- WHY THE STEPS ARE JSONB AND NOT A CHILD TABLE. The steps of a run are read as
-- a unit ("what did last night do, and which part was slow?"), never queried
-- across runs on their own — nobody asks "every step named rate_table_mv since
-- April" without also wanting its run. A child table would buy a join and an
-- ordering column to reconstruct something the job already has in hand as an
-- array. If a cross-run step query ever becomes real, the jsonb unnests into
-- one.
--
-- WHY IT IS APPEND-ONLY. This is the record of what the database did to itself
-- unattended. Rewriting history here would defeat the only reason to keep it:
-- the Insights observatory reads this to say "the numbers you are looking at
-- were last rebuilt at 04:12, and it took 6 minutes". Retention is a later
-- problem — one row a night is 365 rows a year.
