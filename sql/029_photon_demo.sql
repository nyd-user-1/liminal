-- Liminal — Photon e-prescribing demo (029). Three things, all re-runnable:
--   1. Dr. Shelley Padgett's users row (the one practitioner fixture no
--      migration ever created — see the note below).
--   2. Spreads every demo client across the five practitioners.
--   3. clients.photon_patient_id — the Photon patient id we sync to.
--
-- Demo data only. Password for the new login is "demo", via the same bcrypt
-- hash every other demo user carries (copied from an existing row — no new
-- auth mechanism, that IS the demo login).

-- ── 1. practitioner fixtures ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Jason Hilario already lands in 011. Shelley, though, is referenced by 008
-- (slug + provider_profiles, both written as no-ops "until her user row
-- exists") but no migration ever inserted her — she was created by hand on the
-- live DB. That gap means a from-scratch rebuild has 4 practitioners and no
-- /providers/shelley-padgett. This closes it; on the live DB it's a no-op.
-- avatar_hue is CHECK-constrained to (teal, amber, pink, blue) — 5 practitioners
-- can't have 5 distinct hues, so teal repeats. Matches her live row exactly.
INSERT INTO users (id, role, name, email, password_hash, avatar_hue, phone, timezone, slug)
SELECT '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000001006', 'practitioner', 'Dr. Shelley Padgett', 'shelley@liminal.demo',
  (SELECT password_hash FROM users WHERE email = 'brendan@liminal.demo'),
  'teal', '+1 212 555 0144', 'America/New_York', 'shelley-padgett'
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE email = 'brendan@liminal.demo')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- ── 2. spread clients across the practitioners ───────────────────────────────
-- The five role='practitioner' users (Brendan is role='admin' — the practice
-- admin, who sees every client rather than owning a caseload). Deterministic:
-- practitioners ordered by name, clients by created_at, round-robin on the
-- modulo, so re-running lands the same assignment. Overwriting is fine here —
-- it's demo data, and today everything sits on Brendan (8) + Priya (6).
