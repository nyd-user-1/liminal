-- Liminal — 033: the free CMS benchmark layer. Our own CPT vocabulary
-- (`cpt_codes`), the PFS Relative Value File (`cms_rvu` + `cms_gpci` +
-- `cms_pfs_config`), the public HCPCS Level II code set (`hcpcs_codes`), and
-- the view that turns all of it into "% of Medicare" (`medicare_benchmark_ny`).
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. provider_rate_signals holds 9.3M negotiated rates keyed by a
-- bare `billing_code`. A dollar amount alone answers nothing — $142 for 90837
-- is generous in Buffalo and thin in Manhattan. Medicare's allowed amount is
-- the only free, universal, per-locality yardstick, and CMS gives away every
-- input needed to compute it. That converts every rate we hold into a ratio.
--
-- ── THE LICENSING BOUNDARY (the reason this file looks the way it does) ─────
-- CPT codes and their DESCRIPTORS are AMA copyright. The five-digit codes
-- themselves are facts and are not copyrightable — we key on them freely. The
-- descriptor TEXT is not ours: CMS ships it in the PPRRVU file under CMS's own
-- AMA license, which does not extend to us. The file says so on line 2 of
-- itself ("CPT codes and descriptions only are copyright 2026 American Medical
-- Association"). So:
--   * `cms_rvu` deliberately has NO description column. The ingest drops the
--     source's DESCRIPTION column on the floor. This is not an oversight —
--     see scripts/cms/ingest-rvu.mjs and scripts/cms/LICENSE_NOTE.md.
--   * `cpt_codes.display_name` is OUR OWN plain-language wording, written by
--     us, reconciled with the labels already shipping in lib/rate-table.ts.
--   * HCPCS LEVEL II IS THE OPPOSITE CASE and the asymmetry is the point:
--     Level II is CMS-maintained public data, so `hcpcs_codes` stores the
--     official descriptors verbatim and may display them. Level II is also
--     where behavioral health actually lives for Medicaid managed care
--     (H0004, H0015, H2019…).
--
-- ── THE ARITHMETIC ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   allowed = (work_rvu×GPCIw + pe_rvu×GPCIpe + mp_rvu×GPCImp) × CF
-- Every term is in this file. `pe_rvu` has a non-facility and a facility
-- flavor; which applies depends on WHERE the service was rendered, not on the
-- code. We compute non-facility only (an office visit — the behavioral-health
-- default). Facility columns are ingested so the other half is a WHERE clause
-- later, not a re-ingest.

-- 2-char modifier instead) — a different entity, deliberately not loaded.
--

-- ── 6. medicare_benchmark_ny — the payoff ──────────────────────────────────
-- Every NY locality × every code we name, priced the way Medicare prices it.
-- This is the denominator that turns a negotiated rate into "% of Medicare".
--
-- STATUS FILTER — chosen, not assumed. The release PDF says RVUs for status
-- 'A', 'R', and 'T' "are used for Medicare payment". We take A and T and drop
-- R: R is "restricted coverage… if covered, the service is contractor priced",
-- meaning the fee-schedule formula does NOT produce what Medicare pays, so a
-- computed number there would be a confident lie. (91% of R rows carry no RVUs
-- at all.) A = 9,408 rows, T = 8, R = 1,082/104-with-RVUs.
--
-- THIS BITES EXACTLY ONE SEEDED CODE, and it is the right bite: 90846 (family
-- therapy WITHOUT the client present) is status 'R' — it carries RVUs (2.74
-- work / 3.17 total non-facility) but Medicare restricts coverage and lets the
-- contractor price it. So 90846 has NO row in this view, deliberately. That is
-- not a gap to backfill: multiplying its RVUs by the CF would invent a number
-- Medicare does not pay. If a benchmark for it is ever needed, the honest
-- source is the local MAC's fee schedule, not this arithmetic. The other 13
-- seeded codes are 'A' (90847 — family therapy WITH the client — is 'A' and is
-- present, which is the comparison that matters clinically anyway).
--
-- CF: the non-qualifying (non-APM) factor. The APM factor applies only to
-- clinicians who cleared QPP thresholds — a property of the BILLING PARTY, not
-- of the code, and nothing in provider_rate_signals tells us who qualifies. So
-- the honest default is the one that applies to most clinicians.
--
-- Base rows only (modifier = ''): a 26/TC split is a radiology concern, and
-- carrying it here would multiply rows for no behavioral-health gain.
