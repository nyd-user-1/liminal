-- Liminal — 021: provider_rate_summary (one row per NPI, pre-aggregated).
-- Backbone for the ranked provider rate-directory AND the recruiting footprint:
-- reading this ~34k-row matview is instant vs scanning the 8.8M-row fact table.
-- After each rate load: REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY provider_rate_summary;
-- (also refresh provider_participation_summary (023), the rate_bands_* matviews (024), and payer_rate_totals (026))
-- NY-book payers only, dollar types only, deduped (distinct npi×payer×code×rate).
