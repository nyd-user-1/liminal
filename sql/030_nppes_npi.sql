-- Liminal — 030: nppes_npi (the full NPPES dissemination file, nationwide).
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. sql/025's nppes_organizations is NY-scoped by construction
-- ("NY practice location + every npi-type TIN"): 103,772 of its 104,060 rows are
-- NY. That is fine for naming npi-type TINs — those NPIs are in the list by
-- definition — but it cannot name an ein-type group whose organization sits out
-- of state. Measured 2026-07-15: ein:042774441's roster anchors at 300 LONGWOOD
-- AVE, BOSTON MA. BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL is simply absent from our data, so
-- the group renders "Unnamed practice" forever, no matter how good the join is.
-- This table is the whole file — both entity types, every state — so the group
-- naming route (see the matcher in scripts/nppes-name-groups.mjs) can run in SQL
-- against a complete universe instead of a NY keyhole.
--
-- WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a replacement for directory_providers (which carries
-- Medicaid cross-links, profession normalization and slugs) or for
-- nppes_organizations (whose consumers are stable). It is the raw federal
-- identity spine those two could later be rebuilt on — see the consolidation
-- ticket referenced in docs/reports/2026-07-15-nppes-infrastructure.md.
--
-- SELECTED COLUMNS ONLY. The dissemination file is 330 columns / ~10GB
-- unzipped; loading it whole would be ~40GB in Neon for no gain. These are the
-- columns the naming + entity_kind work actually reads, plus the freshness
-- fields scripts/nppes-sync.mjs needs to apply weekly incrementals.
--
-- ── THE TWO MATCH KEYS, AND WHY THEY LOOK LIKE THIS ─────────────────────────
-- Both are STORED generated columns so the match is an indexed equality join
-- rather than a 8.6M-row expression scan, and so every caller normalizes
-- identically (a matcher that normalizes one side differently silently matches
-- nothing — that is exactly how the first local attempt failed).
--
-- addr_key — uppercase, suite designators dropped, then all non-alphanumerics
-- stripped. The designator step is load-bearing and was measured, not guessed:
-- NPI 1477783496's practice location is '109 W 27TH ST STE 5S' while the
-- organization at that same desk (MCCD PSYCHIATRY SERVICES PLLC, Talkiatry's
-- billing entity) publishes '109 W 27TH ST # 5S'. Strip punctuation alone and
-- they are '109W27THSTSTE5S' vs '109W27THST5S' — no match. Drop STE/# first and
-- both land on '109W27THST5S'. ST (street) is deliberately NOT in the list.
--
-- phone keys — digits only, and BOTH the location AND mailing numbers are kept.
-- Also measured: that same MCCD record publishes location tel 917-634-5311 and
-- mailing tel 833-351-8255, while the practitioner at the address publishes
-- 833-351-8255 as his LOCATION phone. A location-to-location phone rule rejects
-- the true match. The matcher compares the practitioner's location phone against
-- either of the organization's numbers.
--
-- Normalization only ever CREATES candidate matches; it never accepts one. The
-- accept/skip decision (exactly one distinct name, else skip) lives in the
-- matcher, so a loose key here cannot invent a name — it can only widen the
-- candidate set that ambiguity detection then throws away.

-- ── nppes_npi ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- One row per NPI, nationwide, both entity types. Loaded by
-- scripts/ingest-nppes-full.mjs (monthly full replacement, chunked COPY);
-- maintained by scripts/nppes-sync.mjs (weekly incremental + deactivations).
