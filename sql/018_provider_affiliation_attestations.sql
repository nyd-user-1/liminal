-- Liminal — 018: provider_affiliation_attestations (Roster Check write path).
--
-- Insert-only log of a provider's own statement about whether they're still
-- affiliated with a TIN a payer publishes them under. This is our proprietary
-- liveness signal — a rate row proves a contract existed on file_date; this
-- table is the provider telling us, in their own words and their own
-- timestamp, whether that contract still describes them. Never inferred,
-- never guessed — always a written attestation.
--
-- Latest row wins per (npi, normalized tin) — read layer takes DISTINCT ON,
-- newest first. Never UPDATE/DELETE a row; a correction is a new row.
