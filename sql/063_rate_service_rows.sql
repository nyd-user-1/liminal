-- Liminal — 063: rate_service_rows_mv — the Services tab's read, all 20 codes.
--
-- WHY A NEW MATVIEW AND NOT A WIDER sql/032. rate_table_child_mv is PIVOTED
-- (c90791…c99214 + n90791…n99214) and pivots exactly five codes, so the Services
-- tab physically cannot show the other fifteen — that is the whole of NYS-50's
-- surfacing gap, and it lives here, not in sql/024. Widening the pivot to twenty
-- codes would mean 40 rate columns and a DROP+CREATE of a 70 MB matview that
-- FOUR other consumers read (lib/repos/rate-table.ts → /published-rates,
-- lib/repos/analytics.ts, lib/analytics/metrics.ts, lib/repos/admin.ts). This
-- file is additive instead: 032 keeps serving them unchanged, and the Services
-- read (lib/repos/rate-rows.ts) points here.
--
-- LONG, NOT PIVOTED. listRateRows already unpivoted 032 back to one-row-per-
-- service via a CROSS JOIN LATERAL (VALUES …) so that LIMIT/OFFSET counted
-- SERVICES rather than cells. This matview IS that grain, so the unpivot goes
-- away: the page becomes a plain top-N over an index instead of an unpivot of
-- 144,865 rows into ~725k tuples followed by a sort.

-- ── THE CAP: 400 LEAVES, AND WHY IT MOVED FROM 100 ─────────────────────────
-- sql/032 excludes a (billing ID, insurer) group holding >100 leaves, so the
-- platform-scale TINs (/orgs owns those rosters) stay out of an inline table.
-- Adding fifteen codes ADDS leaves — a clinician priced only for 90832 is a new
-- (npi, network, setting) leaf — so re-applying `<=100` to the twenty-code leaf
-- set would have EVICTED groups that /rates lists today. Measured 2026-07-20:
--
--   cap   groups   service rows   groups lost vs today   rows lost vs today
--   100   38,688      156,812              157                 9,616
--   150   38,872      179,430               62                 3,977
--   200   38,959      194,315               25                 1,960
--   400   39,067      223,218                0                     0
--
-- 400 is the smallest round threshold that loses NOTHING currently published —
-- deleting 9,616 rows a user can see today, in a change whose whole purpose is
-- to show MORE, would be a regression wearing a feature's clothes. It still
-- excludes the 81 platform groups the cap exists for; the largest is
-- npi:1235600834 (Empire) at 47,182 leaves, then npi:1427671437 at 12,088.
-- The original "nobody reads a 400-row roster inline" concern is now handled by
-- pagination, not by the cap: the Services tab has been server-paginated since
-- NYS-114, so the cap's remaining job is only to keep the platform TINs out.
--
-- COVERAGE, unchanged in kind: same six payers, same rate filters as 032/027 —
-- copied verbatim on purpose. A row here must mean exactly what a row there
-- means, minus the pivot. Callers still must not claim completeness.
