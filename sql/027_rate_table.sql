-- Liminal — 027: rate_table_mv (the published-rates table, /published-rates).
--
-- WHAT A ROW IS. Not a person, not a company: a row is ONE INSURER'S PRICE LIST
-- FOR ONE BILLING GROUP — the party that insurer contracts with and pays. Grain
-- is (tin, payer); the page ships the whole corpus and narrows it client-side,
-- so this MV is the entire query layer: no per-row lookups, no request-time
-- filters.
--
-- WHAT `tin` IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A "TIN" COLUMN. In the CMS Transparency in
-- Coverage schema a provider group is `{npi: [...], tin: {type, value}}`, where
-- type is 'ein' OR 'npi'. So the field is really "the identifier this payer
-- chose to publish for this group" — an EIN, or an NPI standing in for one.
-- The choice belongs to the PAYER, not the provider (measured 2026-07-14):
--   Empire BlueCross  0% ein / 100% npi      Cigna       72% / 28%
--   Fidelis          100% ein /   0% npi      Oxford      65% / 35%
--   MetroPlus        100% ein /   0% npi      EmblemHealth 59% / 41%
-- 28,210 NPIs appear under BOTH an ein-identifier and an npi-identifier — the
-- same human, identified differently by different insurers. An NPI is not a tax
-- ID; do not label this column "TIN" in any UI.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE: one provider legitimately appears in many rows. NPI 1407961386
-- sits in six — three EINs (employers she bills through; the EIN belongs to the
-- employer, not to her) plus npi:1407961386 (billing as herself) and two org
-- NPIs (MEMORIAL GASTROENTEROLOGY GROUP, MSKCC RADIOLOGY GROUP). She does not
-- "have" three EINs. Rows are billing relationships, not people.
--
-- REFRESH ORDER — this MV reads tin_registry, so it must refresh AFTER the
-- names land or ~77% of the table renders "Unnamed practice". It appends to the
-- existing post-ingest routine (canonical copy: sql/README.md, which also has
-- the NPPES monthly-full / weekly-incremental cadence that feeds sql/030):
--
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY provider_rate_summary;            -- 021
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY provider_participation_summary;   -- 023
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rate_bands_*;                     -- 024

--   node --env-file=.env.local scripts/backfill-tin-names.mjs                -- roster-derived names
--   node --env-file=.env.local scripts/nppes-name-groups.mjs                 -- 030 co-located org names
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rate_table_mv;                    -- 027 (this file)
--   ANALYZE;
--
-- nppes-name-groups.mjs reads THIS MV (it asks "which rows still render
-- unnamed?") and writes tin_registry, which this MV reads. That is a real cycle
-- and the order above resolves it: the matcher runs against the PREVIOUS
-- refresh, then the refresh picks up its names. On a first build, run the
-- matcher after the initial CREATE and refresh again.
--
-- orgs-sync.mjs refreshes org_tin_rosters, which this MV joins for roster size /
-- entity kind / NPI search — so 027 refreshes after orgs-sync, not before.
--
-- Build cost ~5-10s (the filtered fact scan is ~4s); well inside Neon's 5-minute
-- per-statement ceiling, so no chunked CREATE TABLE AS needed.
--
-- Query constraints below are NOT optional — each one was measured against live
-- data (2026-07-14) and each silently corrupts the table if dropped:
--  * lower(billing_class) = 'professional' — the column is case-inconsistent
--    ('Professional' vs 'professional'); naive equality drops half the data.
--  * negotiated_type NOT ILIKE '%percent%' — percentage-of-billed-charge rows
--    are not dollar rates. Every other MV in this DB applies this filter.
--  * negotiated_rate > 5 — noise floor.
--  * The payer ALLOWLIST (not a blocklist). Excluded on purpose: both Aetna
--    labels (7.9M of 9.3M rows, ~3,100 distinct 90837 rates, ~4% single-rate
--    resolution — they'd render an almost entirely empty table), UnitedHealthcare
--    of NY (5.6%), Oxford Health Plans (CT) (7.2%), CDPHP (0.0%), out-of-state
--    Blues, Excellus (5 rows). Adding a payer here means proving its single-rate
--    share first.
--  * A TIN shows a rate for a code ONLY if that (tin, payer, code) resolves to
--    exactly ONE distinct value. Multi-rate cells stay NULL and render "—";
--    picking one arbitrarily would invent a fact the payer never published.
