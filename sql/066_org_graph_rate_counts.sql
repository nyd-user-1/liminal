-- Liminal — 066: rate-count rollups for the org relationship map (2026-07-23).
--
-- Ruling: the map's chips no longer summarize spreads. A payer×code cell
-- shows the ONE published rate when there is one, else the COUNT of distinct
-- published rates ("78 rates") — the multiplicity IS the story (one insurer,
-- one org, one code, 78 different prices: it begs "why?"). No medians, no
-- bands on the canvas. That count (count(DISTINCT negotiated_rate)) wasn't
-- carried by org_tin_rate_summary, and ranking an org's providers by a code's
-- rate needs a (tin, npi, billing_code) grain nothing rolls up.
-- provider_rate_signals has no tin index, so both must be matviews, not live
-- queries (the sql/025 NYS-52 lesson: platform TINs seq-scan).
--
-- 1) org_tin_rate_summary — recreated with distinct_rates added (all prior
--    columns unchanged; other readers unaffected).
-- 2) org_tin_npi_rates — NEW rollup at (tin, npi, billing_code): feeds the
--    map's member-edge chips and the "Top paid" provider ranking.
--
-- After every rate load, refresh alongside the sql/025 pair:
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY org_tin_rate_summary;
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY org_tin_rosters;
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY org_tin_npi_rates;
