-- Liminal — 023: provider_participation_summary (per-NPI network aggregate).
--
-- The directory's server-side Accepting/Network sort (session-3 handoff) was
-- aggregating all of provider_network_participation per request — 2.7–5s once
-- the table passed 1M rows. This matview is that GROUP BY, computed once:
-- one row per NPI with participation anywhere.
--
-- Refresh alongside provider_rate_summary after every ingest:
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY provider_participation_summary;
-- Staleness between ingest and refresh only softens a sort ranking — never a
-- membership claim (those read the base table).
