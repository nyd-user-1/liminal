-- Liminal — 017: provider_rate_signals (Transparency-in-Coverage negotiated rates).
--
-- The corroboration layer's second, independent kind of evidence. A negotiated
-- rate proves a CONTRACT existed on the file date — money, not paperwork. It is
-- deliberately its own table, NOT bolted onto provider_network_participation:
-- rates carry a different freshness/confidence profile (as-of semantics, zombie
-- risk) and their own source treatment (MRF files, not FHIR directories).
--
-- THE THREE DISPLAY RULES (structural — see lib/repos/rate-signals.ts):
--  1. negotiated_rate is what the PAYER pays the PROVIDER. Never patient cost.
--     The column is named negotiated_rate — never cost, never price — and the
--     read layer only releases it pre-labeled ("in-network rate · as-of {date}").
--  2. A rate proves a contract on file_date. Every rate-derived claim carries
--     its as-of date.
--  3. MEMBERSHIP vs LIVENESS: a rate row is the payer's own published
--     attestation that the provider is in-network — a fair membership claim on
--     its own. What it does NOT carry: accepting-new-patients or a recency
--     heartbeat (zombie rates are why CMS proposed a Utilization File). Gate
--     accepting/liveness display on a same-payer directory listing; never
--     gate the membership claim.
--
-- Date semantics (distinct on purpose — do not collapse):
--  * file_date = the payer's published MRF date (their claim of currency).
--  * as_of     = the rate's effective date if the file carries one, else the
--                date WE fetched the file (TiC files usually carry only an
--                expiration, so as_of is typically the fetch date).
--
-- tin is REQUIRED: NPIs ride multiple TINs (PoC: 17 NPIs >3 TINs, max 11) and
-- the TIN disambiguates practice affiliation for dedup + corroboration joins.
--
-- Populated by scripts/mrf/load-rate-signals.mjs from scan-tic.mjs CSVs.
-- Idempotent; safe to re-run (exact duplicates collapse on the UNIQUE key).
