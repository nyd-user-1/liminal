// Content Security Policy — REPORT-ONLY on purpose.
//
// The Stripe Connect work (docs/TASK-STRIPE-MARKETPLACE.md T3) called for "CSP
// updated for Stripe frames/scripts", but the app had no CSP at all, so nothing
// was blocking Stripe in the first place. Introducing an *enforcing* policy is a
// much larger change than it looks: it has to cover Photon's e-prescribing
// runtime (api/app/clinical-api across the photon, neutron and boson domains,
// plus Auth0), Vercel Blob assets, and Next's own inline bootstrap/hydration
// scripts — which need either 'unsafe-inline' or a nonce issued from middleware
// this app doesn't have. Getting any of that wrong fails silently in the
// browser, and e-prescribing would be the surface that breaks.
//
// So the policy ships in report-only mode: violations print in the browser
// console and block nothing. TO ENFORCE, in this order:
//   1. Drive every surface (portal, medications/Photon, calls, marketing, this
//      Settings tab) and empty the console of CSP reports.
//   2. Replace 'unsafe-inline' in script-src with a nonce from middleware, or
//      accept it as a documented weakening.
//   3. Rename the header key below to "Content-Security-Policy".
