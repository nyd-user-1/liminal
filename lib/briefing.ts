// briefing.ts — the platform's first AI workflow, kept deliberately small.
//
// It answers one question: "what do we have, what grew, what's thin?" It reads
// the SAME inventory the observatory renders (lib/repos/admin.ts), asks Claude
// for ~150 words of plain English, and caches the answer for 12 hours.
//
// Two rules this file exists to enforce:
//
//  1. NO PHI, EVER. The prompt is built from table counts and payer sync dates
//     — never a client, a name, an appointment, a note. buildFacts() below is
//     the whole prompt surface: if it isn't in there, it can't be sent. The
//     dashboard's Layer-1 practice numbers (caseload, invoices, today's
//     schedule) are deliberately NOT passed in, even though the page has them:
//     they're a small enough population to be identifying, and a narrative is
//     not worth that risk.
//  2. NEVER THROW. No key, no network, a bad response — every path returns a
//     BriefingResult the card can render. The dashboard must not depend on
//     Anthropic being up.

1. What we have — the shape of the corpus, in one or two sentences.
2. What grew — reference the 7-day activity only if it shows something.
3. What's thin — the honest gap. Empty tables, tables not loaded, "NOT BUILT YET" entries, and lopsided coverage are the interesting parts. Say which one you'd fix next and why.
