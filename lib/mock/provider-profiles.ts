      "Hi, I'm Brendan. I'm a licensed clinical social worker who has spent the last fourteen years helping New Yorkers work through anxiety, depression, and the kind of life transitions that don't come with a manual — a new job, a breakup, a diagnosis, a move across the country. I did my clinical training at Fordham and cut my teeth in community mental health before opening a private practice, so I've sat with people across a huge range of circumstances, and I don't rattle easily.\n\nWhat I hear most from new clients is that they've been carrying something alone for a long time and just want a place to finally put it down. That's what our first few sessions are for — not diagnosing you, just understanding what your week actually looks like and what's been hardest to say out loud.",
    approachMd:
      "I lean on cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy, but I'm not precious about modality — I'd rather adapt the approach to you than make you fit the approach. Early sessions are mostly listening; I want to understand your history, your support system, and what's already working before I suggest anything new.\n\nI'm direct but not clinical-sounding — you'll get real reactions from me, including the occasional gentle pushback if I think you're being harder on yourself than the situation calls for. Homework is optional but usually helpful: a thought log, a values exercise, sometimes just noticing a pattern for a week before we talk about it.",
    expectMd:
      "Sessions are 45 minutes, weekly to start, then we adjust the cadence together once things feel more stable. I'll check in on what's changed since we last talked, follow threads that matter to you rather than sticking to a rigid agenda, and periodically zoom out to ask whether therapy is actually moving the needle — if it isn't, we change course. I respond to messages within a business day, and I'm upfront if I think a concern is outside my scope, with a referral ready rather than a dead end.",

      "Hi, I'm Priya. I'm a licensed mental health counselor working primarily with people navigating anxiety, trauma, and the particular pressure of being the one who's supposed to hold everything together — for a family, a partner, a job that never quite turns off.\n\nA lot of my caseload is first- and second-generation clients balancing two sets of expectations at once, but you don't need that background to work with me — I just happen to know that terrain well. I trained at NYU and have spent my career in New York, so the stress of this specific city is not news to me.",
    approachMd:
      "My approach is trauma-informed and somatic-aware — I pay attention to what's happening in your body, not just what you're saying, because anxiety rarely stays only in your thoughts. I use EMDR with clients who are ready to process specific memories, and CBT for the more day-to-day anxious-thought-spiral work.\n\nI move at your pace. Some clients want to get into the hard material right away; others need months of relationship-building first. Both are fine with me — I'll tell you what I'm noticing, but you decide when we go deeper.",
    expectMd:
      "We'll start with a longer intake session to map out your history and what brought you in, then settle into 45-minute weekly sessions. I take notes sparingly during session because I'd rather be looking at you than at a laptop. Between sessions, I'm reachable for brief check-ins if something urgent comes up, and I'll always tell you honestly if I think a different level of care — a psychiatrist for medication, a support group, an intensive program — would serve you better than more of me.",

I work with people moving through grief, chronic illness, and the kind of major health transitions that upend a life overnight — a diagnosis, a caregiving role you didn't choose, a body that suddenly works differently than it used to. I also see a lot of clients in the thick of a difficult pregnancy, postpartum period, or fertility journey.\n\nI came to this work after several years in medical social work at a hospital, so I'm comfortable with the practical and the emotional at the same time — happy to talk through how to have a hard conversation with a doctor and how to sit with the grief underneath it.",
    approachMd:
      "My style blends mindfulness-based approaches with straightforward grief and health psychology frameworks. I don't believe grief is something to 'get through' on a schedule, so we won't rush it — but I will help you build the daily-functioning skills you need while it's still heavy.\n\nI bring in breathing and grounding techniques often, not as an add-on but because a dysregulated nervous system makes everything else harder to work on. Expect some quiet in our sessions; I'm not afraid of it.",

      "Sessions run 45 minutes, and I keep the structure loose in the early weeks of any big transition — some weeks we'll problem-solve logistics, others we'll just sit with how hard it is.

I coordinate with other providers (a physician, a hospice team, a fertility clinic) when a client wants that, with your written consent.",

I played competitive sports through college, and a lot of what I do borrows from that world — building a routine, tracking what actually helps, treating your mental health like something you train, not just something you fix when it breaks.",

I also draw on motivational interviewing when someone's ambivalent about change, which is most people, honestly.\n\nSessions with me feel more like a working conversation than a soft-lit therapy-office cliché. I'll challenge you. I'll also tell you when you're being too hard on yourself, which happens more than people expect.",

I'll ask you to track specific things between sessions — triggers, sleep, what set off a bad week — because patterns are easier to see on paper than in memory.
